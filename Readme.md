# Rescue Your Farm â€“ An action-packed gaming experience

## Background
Once a tranquil hamlet, your village now lies under the siege of a devastating bio-weapon that has left its mark on every living plant. The crops and vegetation have mutated into zombie-like carriers, ready to infect any other greenery that comes into contact with them. As if possessed, these airborne undead plants flutter around, spreading the contagion to unsuspecting flora, wreaking havoc on the once-thriving ecosystem of your village.


## What can you do?
Armed with a shotgun, your mission is to take down these airborne zombie plants before they infect your crops with their deadly contagion.
Notably, these zombie plants emit a luminous glow, making them appear brighter than regular plants even in the darkness.
